# Cryptocurrencies Project

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  In this project, we explore available data to get information about the cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and how they can be classified.

The data used in this project could be find [here](Resources/crypto_data.csv). Since the data does not have a known output about categorization of cryptocurrencies, we will use unsupervised learning algorithm: `K-means`, and a pre-processing transformation: `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)`.
